# Uni-WP Theme

Hi! It's my first time tryin to build a Wordpress Theme! I know it would be a long journey since I just started to learn it. But I think it would be a nice experience!

## File Explanation

-  [x] Index.php for the index page. Using the Wordpress while loop, we can looping post, page etc.
-  [x] On Style.css you need to define theme name, author, and the version on the top of the file.
-  [x] Single.php for single post page. And Page.php for single page type content. It depends on the URL from the index page.
-  [x] Header.php and Footer.php it allows you to make a dynamic header and footer. And also get all css file, and black admin panel bar at the top.
-  [x] Functions.php. Create/call all Wordpress functionality
